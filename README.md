## About the project

This was an assignment given to the developers in the **IDG1293 - Advanced CSS** course at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/).

### What the project does

This project is a single scrollytelling page that aims to inform people about the issues that come from light pollution. It focuses on three main areas related to artificial light:

-   How it can disturb sleep and cause health issues in human beings
-   How it can disorient animals that use natural lights to navigate in the wild
-   How it reduces the visibility of the night sky

### Why the project is useful

Light pollution is an environmental issue that is not specifically mentioned, but is related to 5 out of 17 of the [UN sustainability goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). The related goals depends on specific sub-issues, but they are listed below.

-   [Goal #7](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal7): Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all

-   [Goal #11](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11): Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

-   [Goal #12](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12): Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

-   [Goal #14](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14): Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development

-   [Goal #15](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15): Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss

The site itself does not give a lot of information about the issue at hand, but can hopefully awaken feelings about issues that most people care about, and gives them the opportunity to read more about the issue and what they can do. At the end of the story, the viewer will be presented with a link to the [International Dark-Sky Association](https://www.darksky.org/) where they can read more about the specific issues and how to solve them.
